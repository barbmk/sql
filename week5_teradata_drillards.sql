-- Some time ago I finished a course on Coursera on how to manage Big Data with MySQL. This was the last assignment of the course, done using Teradata and the Dillard's database. I think that the assignment was great to learn so I decided to publish my responses.

-- Exercise 1. How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction table for each month/year combination in the database?

SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate) AS y, EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS m, COUNT(DISTINCT saledate) as num_days
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY y, m
ORDER BY y, m;

-- Exercise 2. Use a CASE statement within an aggregate function to determine which sku had the greatest total sales during the combined summer months of June, July, and August.

SELECT sku, sum(amt) AS sales
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'p' AND EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) IN (6, 7, 8)
GROUP BY sku
ORDER BY sales DESC;

-- Exercise 3. How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction table for each month/year/store combination in the database? Sort your results by the number of days per combination in ascending order.

SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate) AS y, EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) AS m, store, COUNT(DISTINCT saledate) as num_days
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY y, m, store
ORDER BY num_days;

-- Exercise 4. What is the average daily revenue for each store/month/year combination in the database? Calculate this by dividing the total revenue for a group by the number of sales days available in the transaction table for that group.

SELECT store, my, num_days, sales, sales/ num_days as avg_daily_sales

-- Exercise 5. What is the average daily revenue brought in by Dillardâ€™s stores in areas of high, medium, or low levels of high school education?
